# Installation
DownTube currently doesn't have an installer. You will need to unzip the zip file holding all the contents and make damn sure you keep all files including .DLL files and everything with the program in the same directory as the executable or else it won't work and DownTube will give an error. You can find the current release of the program here:

# Support
We currently do not provide any support, maintenance, or help. This program was made with simplicity and if you are having trouble following the program we can't help you. I'm a developer currently maintaining work I have to do and don't have enough time for customer support.
